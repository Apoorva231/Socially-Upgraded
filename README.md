Project Description: Socially-Upgraded
Our Research:
Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often struggle with social communication, recognizing facial expressions, understanding tone of voice, and responding appropriately in conversations. Multiple research shows that structured, repetitive practice in a controlled environment can improve these skills. VR provides a creative, engaging way to simulate various social interactions, allowing children to practice recognizing cues, navigating conversations, and managing emotions in a safe, judgment-free environment. Our project leverages these insights to create an effective, evidence-based tool for social skills training.

Our Vision:
We aim to bridge the social gap for children with
ASD by providing an immersive and interactive
VR experience that enhances social awareness, communication skills, and emotional regulation.
By offering a safe customizable space for repeated practice, we hope to build confidence and foster greater social independence.

Our Project's Impact:
By simulating real-world social interactions, our project empowers children with ASD to develop essential social skills at their own pace. The
ability to practice in a controlled environment reduces anxiety and increases readiness for real-life interactions, ultimately improving their ability to engage in everyday social situations and upgrading their quality of life.

Our Process & Challenges:
We set out to build an interactive VR experience that guides children through various social scenarios, from one-on-one conversations to group dynamics. Our goal was to create realistic and engaging interactions with real-time feedback.

Instructions:
Test your build firs on the Unity Editor:
Use a connection cable to connect the headset to your PC (a charging cord should also work).\ Connect the headset and launch the Meta Developer Hub application.\ To open the Oculus PC App, use the toggle via the Meta Developer Hub.\ When the Oculus Link App launches in the headset, you might need to provide permissions.\ Now the application should be ready to be played in the headset. Press the Play button in the Unity Editor.\

Putting the headset's build into practice:
Start the Meta Developer Hub app with the headset connected.\ Drag and drop the .apk file inside the Meta Developer Hub application.\ Select the option to load straight onto the headset. \ The app should start playing immediately after loading; if not, you can locate it installed on the headset or, if the headset is attached, you can play it via the Meta Developer App.\
